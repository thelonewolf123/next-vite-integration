# Next.js and Vite React Integration Experiment
This repository is an experimental project that demonstrates the integration of Next.js and Vite for building a React web application. Next.js is a powerful React framework for server-rendered applications, and Vite is a lightning-fast build tool for frontend projects. In this experiment, we have taken a Vite single-page application (SPA) and embedded it within a Next.js application, showcasing the seamless collaboration between these two tools.
